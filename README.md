# keyence-image-stitching
Processing Z-stack images from Keyence fluorescent microscopes manually is time-consuming and inefficient. To address this, I developed a custom automated code that stitches images and saves channels separately with a single click. This tool improves workflow efficiency, ensures consistency, reduces errors, and saves significant time.
